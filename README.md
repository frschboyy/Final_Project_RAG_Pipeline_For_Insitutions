# RAG-Powered Institutional Document Intelligence System




## Project Description

Organizations globally, including NGOs, schools, courts, and financial institutions, grapple with vast volumes of unstructured, scanned, or text-heavy documents. The current manual processes for extracting insights from these documents are inefficient and prone to human error. This project proposes the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to address this challenge. The RAG system will integrate retrieval mechanisms with generative AI to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses when querying large document repositories. It aims to provide traceability and transparency by linking outputs back to source materials, significantly reducing the time and effort required for document review and verification.




## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that can assist institutions in accessing information from unstructured documents. The specific objectives include:

1.  **Develop a RAG-based pipeline:** Enable effective querying and retrieval of information from institutional documents.
2.  **Support organizational knowledge management:** Incorporate a basic document classification mechanism.
3.  **Provide concise, query-focused summaries:** Reduce information overload for users.
4.  **Enhance transparency:** Ensure retrieved responses are linked back to their original sources.
5.  **Explore practical strategies:** Handle scanned and unstructured documents through digitization and preprocessing.




## Project Scope

This project will cover:

-   Procuring a dataset of institutional documents (e.g., NGO financial reports, university policies, basic legal/financial docs).
-   OCR preprocessing, text chunking, embedding, retrieval, classification, summarization.
-   End-to-end RAG pipeline with a working demo (Webapp/Streamlit).

The scope may not cover (depending on accuracy/efficiency and time constraints):

-   Multi-language support for OCR.
-   Integration of a working CI/CD pipeline.
-   Highly specialized reasoning in sensitive domains such as law or medicine.
-   Cloud deployment.




## Proposed Methodology

The project will adopt an iterative development approach, starting with a baseline pipeline and progressively integrating additional features. This methodology ensures an early functional prototype, allowing for gradual refinement and expansion.




## Expected Outcomes/Deliverables

**Deliverables:**

*   **Prototype:** A working RAG-powered system that:
    *   Processes institutional documents.
    *   Answers user queries and generates concise, query-relevant summaries.
    *   Includes references to where the information was retrieved from the document(s) + confidence score.
*   **Evaluation Reports:** Benchmarking and analysis of OCR performance, retrieval quality, classification accuracy, and summarization relevance.
*   **Presentation-Ready Demo (Month 3):** Functional interface (e.g., Streamlit/Flask dashboard) showcasing the systemâ€™s ability to retrieve and summarize with traceability.

**Impact:**

*   Improved access to information for NGOs, schools, and institutions dealing with reports and policies.
*   A system that emphasizes trustworthiness by linking outputs back to the source text, reducing risks of misinformation.
*   A practical demonstration of advanced NLP methods adapted to local institutional needs.




## Timeline

**Month 1:**
*   Collect sample documents
*   OCR testing (Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Vision)
*   Text/Image cleaning + chunking
*   Basic embedding + retrieval
*   Build baseline RAG

**Month 2:**
*   Add document classification
*   Add query-focused summarization
*   Improve retrieval accuracy and speed

**Month 3:**
*   Add traceability and confidence scoring
*   Continue improving efficiency of different parts of the pipeline
*   Add simple user interface for document upload and queries




## Resources Required

*   **Computing:** Google Colab
*   **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow
*   **Retrieval Tools:** FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone (optional)
*   **OCR Tools:** Tesseract-OCR, PaddleOCR, Google Vision API, etc.
*   **Frontend Frameworks:** Streamlit or Flask
*   **RAG Toolkits:** LlamaIndex, LangChain, and related libraries for document ingestion, indexing, and orchestration.
*   **Embedding Models:** Open-source Transformer models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, SentenceTransformers) or APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere).
*   **Datasets:** Publicly available institutional documents (e.g., NGO reports, school policies, legal/financial samples).




## Potential Challenges and Mitigation

**Time Constraints:**
*   **Challenge:** Learning and implementing a RAG pipeline, along with exploring new tools and techniques.
*   **Mitigation:** Adopting an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach to development, focusing on delivering a working system with core value early to mitigate scope creep.

**Scanned PDFs and Unstructured Documents:**
*   **Challenge:** Previous experience with OCR on scanned PDFs resulted in messy and inaccurate outputs with certain tools.
*   **Mitigation:** Continuous testing and experimentation with various OCR tools and preprocessing techniques to ensure the best possible output quality.

**Compute Limitations:**
*   **Challenge:** Using Google Colab's free tier imposes limited compute resources, restricting the size and complexity of models that can be used.
*   **Mitigation:** Exploring options to upgrade to a paid tier or leveraging smaller, more efficient models that can achieve the required accuracy within the available compute.
